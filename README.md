<p>LG DisplaySuite + MonitorControl icons designed by Abdülhamid Öztürk for open use. Anyone interested in improving the design should feel free to ask me for a mockup or clean up and modernize it as time goes on. Not every icon fitting into the guidelines Apple has been using for the last couple generations of macOS generates a need and brand theming is a part of these both companies often both working together and having hardware and software supporting each other.</p>

<p>These are the icons I designed as I see fit however any feedback would be great. Monitor Control and the original software from LG icons both have been designed as as a one matching suite.  If there are people interested on another idea or topic I would love to provide.</p>
<p>Feel free to use and modify them.</p>
<p>In Peace,</p>

# LG DisplaySuite + Monitor Control Icons

LG DisplaySuite + MonitorControl icons designed by Abdülhamid Öztürk for open use. Anyone interested in improving the design should feel free to ask me for a mockup or clean up and modernize it as time goes on. Not every icon fitting into the guidelines Apple has been using for the last couple generations of macOS generates a need and brand theming is a part of these both companies often both working together and having hardware and software supporting each other.

These are the icons I designed as I see fit however any feedback would be great. Monitor Control and the original software from LG icons both have been designed as as a one matching suite.  If there are people interested on another idea or topic I would love to provide.

Feel free to use and modify them.

In Peace,

Abdülhamid Öztürk
